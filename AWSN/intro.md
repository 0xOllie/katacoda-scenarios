# Welcome!
Thank you for checking out my Katacoda course.

These challenges will test your new found linux knowledge! Linux operating systems are widely used in corporate network architectures. As a penetration tester, security consultant or CTF competitor, you'll almost certainly come across a Linux OS.

Additionally, majority of security tools are predominantly built for linux. As we spoke about in the presentation, Kali Linux comes prepackaged with majority of the security tools you need to play CTF's or in the industry as a penetration tester! Next month we'll walk you through using kali, but tonight you'll be crackin' hashes and smashin' through linux like the hacker rockstars that you are <3
